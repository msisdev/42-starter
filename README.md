## What is this?

`42-starter` is...
- a C project starter
- with an opinionated folder structure
- for ecole 42

that supports automated tasks that run whenever you push a commit such as...
- [norminette](https://github.com/42school/norminette) test
- build project
- run custom tests

> [!NOTE]
> These features depend on [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and require your repo to be placed in Github. It is free and available in both public and private repo.

> [!NOTE]
> `42-starter` is opinionated and requires you to use the same folder structure and `Makefile` because the Github Action workflows depend on them.
